I chose http, filesystem (fs), and path for my deeper exploration in task 1

2a:

1. http
The http module is used to create an HTTP server and client in Node.js. 
It allows developers to set up servers that can handle HTTP requests and responses, 
making it a foundational piece for web applications. It supports various request and response methods,
 including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

2. filesystem (fs)
The fs module provides an API for interacting with the file system. 
It allows reading, writing, updating, and deleting multiple files. 
This module supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations (multiple files, one file) 
making it versatile for various file handling tasks in Node.js applications.

3. path
The path module provides options for working with file and directory paths. 
It is useful for handling file paths in a way that is portable across different OS.
This module helps in constructing paths, resolving absolute paths, and normalizing path strings.
